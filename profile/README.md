## Description

Bountive is a a platform with a fully onchain lottery system build on <a href="https://starknet.io/">StarkNet</a>! 

## On-chain Lottery Game

There will be several winners per week and a jackpot for whoever finds the right numbers.
We will use the randomness of Empiric Network (currently in Beta) to generate the grid with the winning numbers and I think if we have a little time to use Yagi for automation to make weekly draws

## Goal

The goal is to find the right combination of 7 numbers that will be drawn randomly.
As a player you just need to choose 7 numbers and wait for the weekly draw.

## What we use

### 1- Web3 AUTH

### 2- RAMP
Allowing users to buy crypto directly with a credit card

### 3- Randomness w/Empiric_Network 

### 4- Automate the draw with Yagi Finance

In order not to need to call by hand and for the lottery to be autonomous, we will then use <a href="https://docs.yagi.fi/">Yagi Finance</a> which will allow us to automatically execute our draw function

## 5- Next step

We will continue this project and we will continue all October for the Encode hackathon.

Next features: <br>
 Modif UI/UX <br>
 Automation of the lottery <br>
 Deploy on mainnet <br>
 First Collaboration & more games incoming <br>
