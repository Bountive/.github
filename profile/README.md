<br>
<br>

## Description

Bountive is a a platform with a fully onchain lottery system build on <a href="https://starknet.io/">StarkNet</a>!
Every week a player will be awarded the lucky prize just by participating

## On-chain Lottery Game

There will be several winners per week and a jackpot for whoever finds the right numbers.
We will use the randomness of Empiric Network (currently in Beta) to generate the grid with the winning numbers and I think if we have a little time to use <a href="https://yagi.fi/">Yagi</a> for automation to make weekly draws

## Goal

The goal is to find the right combination of 7 numbers that will be drawn randomly.
As a player you just need to choose 7 numbers and wait for the weekly draw.

We also want to make the user experience as smooth as possible where anyone can join the lottery.

## Installation

We have 2 repository: <br>
`bountive-contractss`             -> Repo with our Smart Contract <br> 
`Bountive_App `                   -> Repo of our App <br>

## What we will use

### 1- Web3 AUTH

We use Web3auth to facilitate the connection of users who do not have ArgentX or Bravos wallet.

### 2- RAMP
Allowing users to buy crypto directly with a credit card.

### 3- Randomness w/Empiric_Network

For the draw of the winning numbers we use the randomness of the empiric network

### 4- Automate the draw with Yagi Finance

In order not to need to call by hand and for the lottery to be autonomous, we will then use <a href="https://docs.yagi.fi/">Yagi Finance</a> which will allow us to automatically execute our draw function

## Next step

We will continue this project and we will continue all October for the Encode hackathon.

Next features: <br>
 Revant the UI/UX design: (we are going to do a graphic overhaul with a designer team. we are going to do a graphic overhaul with a designer team
 To have a completely different experience)<br>
 Automation of the lottery: (For our lottery to be self-managed, we need to add automation using Yagi Finance) <br>
 Deploy v1.0 on mainnet: (We want to release a first completely autonomous version on the basic lottery to focus on collaborations)<br>
 First Collaboration & more games incoming: (In the future we want to bring together as many people from the ecosystem as possible but also to work with     other projects present on StarkNet) <br>
